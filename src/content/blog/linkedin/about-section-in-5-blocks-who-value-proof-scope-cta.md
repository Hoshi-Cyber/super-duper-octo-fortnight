## Outcome in 30 seconds

Convert profile views into leads. Use five blocks to communicate relevance fast.

## What matters and what to ignore in Kenya

### Signal 1: introduce who you are and what you solve

One line on role and problem. First person. Present tense.

### Signal 2: articulate value, proof, and scope

Value: methods you use. Proof: metric. Scope: industries or functions.

## Steps

### Step 1: write the five blocks

- **Who** — current or target role and problem you solve  
- **Value** — methods or approach  
- **Proof** — quantified achievement  
- **Scope** — industries or functions  
- **CTA** — invite contact

### Step 2: localise with Kenya context

Use KES, sector names, counties, and relevant examples. Balance global and local language.

### Step 3: end with a clear call to action

Specify how to engage you and for what.

## Table: five-block template examples

| Role | Example five-block summary |
|---|---|
| Supply chain analyst | Who: I help FMCG firms cut delivery times and costs. Value: I use data analytics and process mapping. Proof: Reduced logistics costs by **15%** for a Nairobi distributor. Scope: Healthcare, retail, agritech. CTA: Let’s streamline your supply chain. |
| Software developer | Who: I build fintech apps for seamless mobile payments. Value: Kotlin and microservices. Proof: Led a team processing **KES 2B** without downtime. Scope: Banking, telecom, agritech. CTA: Need secure payment solutions? Reach out. |
| HR consultant | Who: I guide SMEs on hiring and retention. Value: Competency frameworks and onboarding. Proof: Helped **50+** businesses improve retention **20%**. Scope: Startups and NGOs. CTA: Let’s optimise your people pipeline. |
