## Outcome in 30 seconds

See how to transform weak task bullets into quantified outcomes recruiters prefer.

## What matters and what to ignore in Kenya

### Signal 1: numbers first

Lead with the metric. Keep verbs simple. Use **KES** and %.

### Signal 2: scope and tool

Name the system, scale, or region to demonstrate complexity.

## Steps

### Step 1: pick a weak bullet

Example (before): “Handled supplier invoices.”

### Step 2: rewrite with metric

After: “Processed **1,200** supplier invoices per month with **99.8%** accuracy, cutting late fees by **KES 320K**.”

## Table: six role families, before → after

| Role | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Finance | “Managed petty cash” | “Digitised petty cash with monthly **KES 500K** throughput; cut reconciliation time **40%**.” |
| Sales | “Talked to clients” | “Closed **KES 18M** ARR; **22%** win-rate improvement with 3-step demo flow.” |
| Ops | “Coordinated deliveries” | “Raised OTIF from **81% → 93%** by route batching and vendor scorecards.” |
| IT | “Maintained systems” | “Cut downtime **35%**; MTTR from **3h → 1.9h** across 120 nodes.” |
| HR | “Handled onboarding” | “Reduced time-to-productivity **25%** via 7-day preboarding and LMS playbooks.” |
| Customer Support | “Resolved tickets” | “Improved FCR **+14pp**; CSAT **4.6/5** on 2,400 tickets/quarter.” |

## Checklist (publish-ready)

- [ ] Metric first, action next  
- [ ] Scope named (KES, volume, users, regions)  
- [ ] Max 2 lines per bullet  
- [ ] Consistent tense and punctuation

## Proof and pitfalls

Proof: metric-led rewrites lift response rates. Pitfalls: unverifiable numbers, buzzwords, and run-on sentences.
