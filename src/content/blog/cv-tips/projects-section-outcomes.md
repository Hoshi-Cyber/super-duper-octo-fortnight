## Outcome in 30 seconds

Projects prove capability quickly. Structure them as short caselets with clear outcomes.

## What matters and what to ignore in Kenya

### Signal 1: outcome-first mini caselets

1–2 lines each. Name goal, method, and result in **KES** or %.

### Signal 2: relevance to target role

Prefer projects that mirror the job’s problems.

## Steps

### Step 1: pick 3–5 projects

Include university, freelance, volunteer, or internal improvement work.

### Step 2: write A→M→R

**Action → Metric → Result**. Add links to artefacts or code where applicable.

## Table: project caselets

| Project | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Inventory dashboard (Power BI) | Cut stock-outs **-28%** across 12 branches; alerts via WhatsApp API |
| Route optimisation (Python) | Reduced fuel costs **-11%** in Western region pilot |
| E-commerce revamp (Shopify) | Checkout conversion **+18%** after UX simplification |

## Checklist (publish-ready)

- [ ] 3–5 outcome-first caselets  
- [ ] Links to artefacts or code  
- [ ] Metrics in **KES** or %

## Proof and pitfalls

Proof: outcome-first projects offset experience gaps. Pitfalls: task lists and vague claims.

## CTA

Get the **Job Market Toolkit** and use the **CV Bullet Generator** to convert duties into impact.
