## Outcome in 30 seconds

Targeted skills increase match scores and interview rates. Map core hard and soft skills to the role family.

## What matters and what to ignore in Kenya

### Signal 1: role-based clustering

Group skills by function to avoid noise. Prioritise tools used locally.

### Signal 2: proof next to skills

Add one proof artefact or metric for each top skill.

## Steps

### Step 1: pick 8–12 core skills

Balance methods, tools, and domain knowledge.

### Step 2: pair each skill with proof

Portfolio link, metric, certification, or system you used.

## Table: example matrix

| Role family | Hard skills | Soft skills |
|---|---|---|
| Finance | IFRS, reconciliations, Excel, Power BI | Stakeholder comms, accuracy, prioritisation |
| Ops | SOP design, Lean, inventory, logistics | Coordination, problem solving, time management |
| Sales | CRM, discovery, proposals, negotiation | Listening, persistence, objection handling |
| IT | Networks, SQL, scripting, cloud basics | Incident comms, documentation, teamwork |

## Checklist (publish-ready)

- [ ] 8–12 skills only, clustered by role  
- [ ] One proof artefact per top skill  
- [ ] No generic lists without evidence

## Proof and pitfalls

Proof: targeted matrices reduce screening friction. Pitfalls: laundry lists and irrelevant tools.
