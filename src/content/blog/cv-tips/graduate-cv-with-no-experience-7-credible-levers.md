## Outcome in 30 seconds

Lack of experience is not lack of value. Use seven levers to build credibility and win interviews in Kenya’s market.

## What matters and what to ignore in Kenya

### Signal 1: leverage academic and community projects

Projects prove capability. Quantify outcomes. Leadership in societies counts if tied to results.

### Signal 2: develop in-demand skills and certifications

Pick courses with projects you can show. One strong artefact beats many certificates.

## Steps

### Step 1: build a project portfolio

Create 2–3 projects aligned to your target role. Publish on GitHub or a personal site.

### Step 2: volunteer strategically

Choose roles with measurable outcomes. Log organisation, role, dates, and results.

### Step 3: craft seven levers

1) Target role statement  
2) Key skills  
3) Academic projects  
4) Volunteer experience  
5) Certifications  
6) Awards and achievements  
7) Personal development

## Table: graduate levers and examples

| Lever | Example |
|---|---|
| Target role statement | “Aspiring supply chain analyst skilled in Excel and logistics planning.” |
| Academic project | “Built a cost model for a maize co-op. Identified **KES 500,000** annual savings.” |
| Volunteer experience | “Managed social media for a youth mentorship programme. **200%** follower growth in 3 months.” |
| Certification | “Google Data Analytics cert with capstone on Kenya inflation trends.” |
| Award | “Won university hackathon. Rural water tracking app used by **300** households.” |
