## Outcome in 30 seconds

Signal governance readiness and value creation at scale. Lead with strategy, risk, capital allocation, and stakeholder outcomes.

## What matters and what to ignore in Kenya

### Signal 1: governance and compliance

Reference board committees, audit, risk, ESG, and reporting cadence aligned to CMA codes and NSE norms.

### Signal 2: capital and transformation

Show portfolio impact: ROIC, EBITDA, market share, expansions, and M&A.

## Steps

### Step 1: executive summary with positioning

Two to four lines. Name sector, scale, and signature results.

### Step 2: board-ready evidence

List committee work, policies approved, and disclosures improved.

### Step 3: outcomes per role

3–5 bullets per role with KES and ratios. Include regional mandates (EA, SSA).

## Table: governance signals to include

| Area | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Audit & Risk | Clean opinions, risk appetite set, loss events reduced |
| ESG | Emissions baseline, diversity goals, supplier audits |
| Strategy | Portfolio rebalancing, capex discipline, ROIC gains |

## Checklist (publish-ready)

- [ ] Positioning summary with sector and scale

## Proof and pitfalls
